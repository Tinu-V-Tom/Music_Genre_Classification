# Music_Genre_Classification

## Introduction

Music genre classification is an essential task in the field of music information retrieval, with applications ranging from music recommendation systems and playlist generation to enhancing user experiences in music streaming services. This task involves predicting the genre of a music track based on its audio features and accompanying metadata. The combination of these elements provides a rich dataset for building effective machine learning models.

## Problem Statement

The core problem is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the genre of a music track. The model will use a set of relevant features including acousticness, danceability, energy, liveness, loudness, tempo, and various metadata attributes to make these predictions. The challenge lies in accurately mapping these features to a specific genre, given the diverse nature of music.

## Data

The dataset for this problem includes a variety of columns:
- **Track Name**: The name of the music track.
- **Popularity**: A measure of the track's popularity.
- **Acousticness**: The likelihood of the track being acoustic.
- **Danceability**: How suitable the track is for dancing.
- **Energy**: The intensity and activity of the track.
- **Instrumentalness**: The likelihood of the track being instrumental.
- **Key**: The key in which the track is composed.
- **Liveness**: The presence of a live audience in the track.
- **Loudness**: The overall loudness of the track.
- **Voice Gender**: The gender of the vocalist(s) in the track.
- **Mode**: The modality (major or minor) of the track.
- **Speechiness**: The presence of spoken words in the track.
- **Tempo**: The tempo of the track.
- **Musician Category**: The category of the musician or band.
- **Valence**: The musical positiveness conveyed by the track.
- **Music Genre**: The target variable representing the genre of the track.

## Objective

The main objective is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the genre of a music track using the provided features. This involves preprocessing the data, selecting relevant features, training the model, and evaluating its performance. The ultimate goal is to achieve high accuracy and F1 score, ensuring the model's generalization ability across different music tracks.

## Evaluation

To assess the performance of the machine learning model, the F1 score will be used as the primary evaluation metric. This score balances precision and recall, providing a single metric that accounts for both false positives and false negatives. The model will be trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on a separate test set to ensure it can generalize well to unseen tracks.

## Conclusion

Music genre classification is a multifaceted problem that requires a deep understanding of both audio features and metadata. By leveraging these features, we can develop robust machine learning models that enhance the capabilities of music recommendation systems and other applications. Through careful preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, we aim to build a system that accurately classifies music genres, contributing to the broader field of music information retrieval.
